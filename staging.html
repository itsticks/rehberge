            A Sculpture In My Hands was conceived between summer 2021 and spring 2022, slowly and darkly ~ ~ ~<br/>
            a collection of dreams, reflections, and premonitions, a testament to patience<br/>
            the drone pieces (Full Moon Light Falls, Telepathic Mail, Heart of Water) were all recorded improvisations from the spring of 2022, just before the other songs were recorded, on a Yamaha mtx8<br/><br/>
                        
            thanks to Sean Armstrong for playing bass on It's All On My Mind <em>(track 8)</em>, and for playing piano on Pathway, <em>(track 11)</em>.<br/>
            
            the bird voice on Tomorrow is a Star is thanks to the nightingale, singing one spring night by Pl&ouml;tzensee
            rain on Oh Alvina <em>(track 7)</em> was recorded outside the window of my room<br/>
            
            the album art is 'Decision on the White Plate' a painting by Agnese Guido<br/>
            
            thank you to my family for loving me and supporting me, & to my friends for choosing me<br/>
            
            i dedicate A Sculpture In My Hands to the memory of my friend, Benjamin Tenisci Stevenson

        <p><strong>Rocky Lorelei</strong> represents the solo musical work of Rachel Lauren Taylor, who was born and raised beside Lake Ontario in Toronto, and is currently set up in Berlin.<br/>
She uses guitar as her primary instrument for songwriting and arranging, and an analog synthesizer for ad hoc drone pieces.<br/>
Her musical processes run parallel to her psychic processes; writing and recording songs is her most vital means of cultivating an understanding of her inner and outer life experiences, bringing a symmetry to her music and her sense of self.<br/>
Her approach to her music is largely intuitive ; usually led by a melody, a string of words, and a feeling, she holds the idea in reflection, works on it, and waits, until the song's identity is realized in fullness.<br/>
Rachel has been fascinated with recording onto tape cassettes since she was a small child, and it remains her preferred medium for recording music.

<p><strong>Sean Armstrong</strong> - a songwriter and home recordist from Scotland living in Berlin. He was raised in remote corners of the Scottish Highlands and Islands, where he would walk beside the iron-grey sea. As a young grown up, he moved to Glasgow to study human beings. It was there that music found him, saved him, and simultaneously destroyed his life. Sean's music is handmade, all over the place, and to the point. He enjoys singing about love, harmony and nature, and attempts to channel the special sense of timelessness that he finds in his favourite music, which is mostly of the past.
