                    A Tiny Rose Made Out Of Clay was recorded by Slipper over 7 days and nights between April and June 2023, in both Berlin and Stanisławów; then it was mixed at home in the seasons that followed.  <br/><br/>

                <p><strong>Slipper</strong> was formed in 2019 by songwriters Sean Armstrong and Rachel Taylor, but it became what felt like a real band when they were joined by Jakub Tyro-Niezgoda in 2020.  
                    Using guitar, bass, drums, and vocal harmonies, they conjure a sound of their own that is simple and true. They record, mix, and release their own music between Berlin and Warsaw.

            Forces is a compilation of nine songs written and collected between 2012 and 2022. The album addresses the forces that
            rule our lives; our connection to nature and also the obstacles that seem to get in the way of us having more harmonious
            relationships with each other and our environment. The songs speak to decisive moments: when a calling received a
            response, when a wave was caught, when an image was captured. Forces was recorded at home in Berlin, with field
            recordings gathered in Panama and Europe.<br /><br />
        
                    Conceived as an artwork, Forces comes with analog photographs that were taken in the same 10-year period. The artist has
                    produced a handbound, signed, limited edition book of 100 copies with the images and lyrics that you can purchase
                    directly from her by writing to <a href="mailto:connect@elaspalding.com">connect@elaspalding.com</a><br /><br />
        
                    Co–produced with Estudio Nuboso (<a href="www.estudionuboso.org" target="_blank">www.estudionuboso.org</a>) part of the proceeds go towards the care of a very special piece
                    of cloud forest in Panama - El Jilguero Reserve.<br /><br />
        
            Music and lyrics by Ela Spalding<br />
            On Goldmines: cello, arrangement and mix by Barnaby Tree. And the band version with Manuel Ferrer, Benito Berm&uacute;dez and
            David Capar&oacute;, recorded live by Diego Pitt&iacute;.<br />

                <p><strong>Ela Spalding</strong> is a mother of two, daughter, sister, partner and friend; a multimedia artist~facilitator bringing people
                closer to themselves, others, nature and the places we inhabit through sound, books, words, somatics, installations and
                cross-disciplinary collaborations. She finds in music a free space to express the multiplicity of experiences and
                emotions she gathers and encounters in daily life, while working and walking in the fields of art, ecology and being
                human. She is the founder of Estudio Nuboso and has an artistic practice that she shares between Berlin, Panama and
                beyond.

        <p><strong>rocky lorelei</strong> represents the solo musical work of Rachel Lauren Taylor, who was born and raised beside Lake Ontario in Toronto, and is currently set up in Berlin.<br/>
She uses guitar as her primary instrument for songwriting and arranging, and an analog synthesizer for ad hoc drone pieces.<br/>
Her musical processes run parallel to her psychic processes; writing and recording songs is her most vital means of cultivating an understanding of her inner and outer life experiences, bringing a symmetry to her music and her sense of self.<br/>
Her approach to her music is largely intuitive; usually led by a melody, a string of words, and a feeling, she holds the idea in reflection, works on it, and waits, until the song's identity is realized in fullness.<br/>
Rachel has been fascinated with recording onto tape cassettes since she was a small child, and it remains her preferred medium for recording music.

<p><strong>Sean Armstrong</strong> - a songwriter and home recordist from Scotland living in Berlin. He was raised in remote corners of the Scottish Highlands and Islands, where he would walk beside the iron-grey sea. As a young grown up, he moved to Glasgow to study human beings. It was there that music found him, saved him, and simultaneously destroyed his life. Sean's music is handmade, all over the place, and to the point. He enjoys singing about love, harmony and nature, and attempts to channel the special sense of timelessness that he finds in his favourite music, which is mostly of the past.
